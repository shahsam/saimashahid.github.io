Transposable Elements (TEs) are DNA fragments that can mobilize and mutate the genome, causing hundreds of diseases and progression of certain types of cancer. To prevent new mutations, the cell ‘flags’ TE regions with chemical modifications such as methylation of DNA (in plants and mammals), and histone H3 lysine 9 residues (conserved from yeast to humans). These modifications mark TE regions for long-term ‘constitutive heterochromatin’ transcriptional silencing and are epigenetically passed to daughter cells after division to prevent reactivation.

Plants have become a premier system to molecularly dissect heterochromatin formation, due to intense research on the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. In the model plant _Arabidopsis_, de novo RdDM of new TEs occurs in three distinct stages – initiation, establishment and maintenance. Multiple studies have addressed how heterochromatin is epigenetically maintained, but little is known about how cells initially detect and silence newly inserted TEs without prior chromatin marks. This project aims to understand the mechanism and molecular players underlying _de novo_ initiation of TE silencing in _Arabidopsis_.
