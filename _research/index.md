I am broadly interested in the noncoding genome, which includes small RNA genes, promoter regions, and transposable elements (TEs). I use both bioinformatics and wet lab approaches to understand how such noncoding elements function and regulate plant growth, development and stress response. Below are some of my current research projects.

**Role of epigenetics in Soybean aphid virulence to aphid-resistant plants**

Growing evidence suggests an important role for DNA methylation in host-pathogen and host-parasite interactions, even though the mechanism and the implication of such interactions are poorly characterized. We aim to determine the role of DNA methylation in soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) virulence against host plants. This project is a collaboration with [Andrew Michel](https://entomology.osu.edu/our-people/andrew-michel) and [Ashley Yates-Stewart](https://entomology.osu.edu/our-people/ashley-yates-stewart) at the Ohio State University.
