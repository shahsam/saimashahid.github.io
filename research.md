## _De novo_ initiation of epigenetic silencing ##

Transposable Elements (TEs) are DNA fragments that can mobilize and mutate the genome, causing hundreds of diseases and progression of certain types of cancer. To prevent new mutations, the cell ‘flags’ TE regions with chemical modifications, thereby marking these regions as transcriptionally-repressed heterochromatin. Multiple studies have addressed how heterochromatin is epigenetically maintained, but little is known about how cells initially detect and silence newly inserted TEs without prior chromatin marks.
