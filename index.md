I am a plant biologist interested in mobile RNA/DNA molecules that regulate gene expression within, and across species. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral research associate in [Keith Slotkin's epigenetics lab][ddpsc] at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. I received my Ph.D. in plant biology from Penn State University, working in [plant small RNA annotation][ss] and mobile [parasitic plant miRNAs][dodder] with [Mike Axtell][axtell_lab]. Previously, I worked as a research associate in the plant biotechnology lab of [Zeba Seraj][du] at the University of Dhaka. I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the same university.
