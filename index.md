I am a plant biologist interested in mobile RNA/DNA molecules that regulate gene expression within and across species. Currently, I am a Simons fellow for the Life Science Research Foundation, working with [Keith Slotkin][ddpsc] on mobile Transposable Elements at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. I received my Ph.D. in plant biology from Penn State University, working in [plant small RNA annotation][ss] and [mobile parasitic plant miRNAs][dodder] with [Mike Axtell][axtell_lab]. Previously, I worked as a research associate in the plant biotechnology lab of [Zeba Seraj][du] at the University of Dhaka. I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the same university.
