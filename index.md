I am a plant biologist studying mobile, noncoding RNA/DNA molecules that can regulate gene expression in the host species. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral research associate in Keith Slotkin's lab at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. I received my Ph.D. in plant biology from Penn State University, working in plant small RNA annotation with Michael Axtell. Previously, I worked as a research associate in the plant biotechnology lab of Zeba Seraj at the University of Dhaka. I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the same university.
