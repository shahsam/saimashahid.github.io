I am broadly interested in the noncoding genome, which includes small RNA genes, promoter regions, and transposable elements (TEs). I use both bioinformatics and wet lab approaches to understand how such noncoding elements function and regulate plant growth, development and stress response. Below are some of my current research projects.
