title: "Role of epigenetics in Soybean aphid virulence to aphid-resistant plants*"
---
Growing evidence suggests an important role for DNA methylation in host-pathogen and host-parasite interactions, even though the mechanism and the implication of such interactions are poorly characterized. We aim to determine the role of DNA methylation in soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) virulence against host plants. This project is a collaboration with [Andrew Michel](https://entomology.osu.edu/our-people/andrew-michel) and [Ashley Yates-Stewart](https://entomology.osu.edu/our-people/ashley-yates-stewart) at the Ohio State University.
